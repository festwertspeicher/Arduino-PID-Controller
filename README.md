This project is based on the Adafruit Sous-Vide controller by Bill Earl, but with the following changes:

* Cheap 1602 LCD Panel instead of the Adafruit RGB LCD Shield
* Encoder with push button instead of a keypad
* Robust Hardware Design (not in this Repo)
* Navigation Menu
* and other minor changes
